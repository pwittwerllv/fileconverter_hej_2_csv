# fileconverter_hej_2_csv
Script reads .hej files containing genealogic data and converts them to csv. 4 csvs are generated personen, mrg, ortv, quellv. 'adop' seems to be another potential part of these files, but no data was included in the investigates .hej file, so no conclusions/conversions can be made for now.
